title: Migrating This Website to HTTPS
subtitle: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Embrace the Secure-Socket Layer

I recently converted `racecondition.software` to HTTPS. This post discusses this change and will act as a smoke test, by which I mean that if this post doesn't show up in my RSS reader, I will have more work to do.

The [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) I followed to use AWS S3 to host my website resulted in a website that was served via HTTP rather than HTTPS. This result caused two problems.

First, Google has [publicly stated](https://searchengineland.com/googles-gary-illyes-https-may-break-ties-between-two-equal-search-results-230691) that HTTPS websites receive better treatment than HTTP websites in search rankings. One of the goals of `racecondition.software` is to reach as many readers as possible, and, given that Google search is a potential source of readers, HTTP was an impediment to reaching that goal.

Second, HTTP websites now bear stigmata of insecurity in various browsers.

{% include image.html
    file="https/Safari.png"
    alt="HTTP Website in Safari"
    caption="HTTP Website in Safari"
    source_link=null
    half_width=false
%}

{% include image.html
    file="https/Chrome.png"
    alt="HTTP Website in Chrome"
    caption="HTTP Website in Chrome"
    source_link=null
    half_width=false
%}

{% include image.html
    file="https/Firefox.png"
    alt="HTTP Website in Firefox"
    caption="HTTP Website in Firefox"
    source_link=null
    half_width=true
%}

I could not allow my [precious](https://images.app.goo.gl/KUsvFZXWoLiTohzJA) website to suffer these stigmata.

Given these problems with HTTP, I decided to implement HTTPS. For reasons that are unclear to me, AWS requires use of its content-delivery network, CloudFront, to serve static websites via HTTPS. I spent a few hours with [a support article](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/) and hit some roadblocks. I signed up for the lowest-tier AWS support plan and submitted a support request. To my delight, a fellow named Imran analyzed my request that evening and told me precisely what to do. I followed his instructions, and HTTPS appears to be working.

When I chose S3, I had no idea that using HTTPS would involve effort that seemed, at the time, [Herculean](https://sites.google.com/site/basicgreekmythology/hero-s/hercules/cleaning-the-augean-stables-in-a-single-day). I don't regret the choice of S3, but anyone considering S3 _should_ be aware. Although Squarespace does not use HTTPS [by default](http://www.immigrationapp.biz), their [support article](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205815898-Squarespace-and-SSL) makes enabling HTTPS look easier than on S3. If HTTPS is a requirement for a new website, Squarespace and perhaps [Wix](https://support.wix.com/en/article/enabling-https-for-your-wix-site) may be easier options than S3. That said, the fast, inexpensive support I got from AWS mitigates this possible disadvantage.
