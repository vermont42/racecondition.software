## Introduction

I've been listening to podcasts for twelve years. I am subscribed to fifty-one and maintain a [repo](https://github.com/vermont42/Podcasts/) of podcasts of interest to iOS developers. As an avid podcast listener, I've long been interested in creating my own podcast. I actually got permission from my employer five years ago to create one and even bought a fancy podcasting mic. But with my non-work focus on [other](https://github.com/vermont42/Conjuguer) [endeavors](https://racecondition.software/blog/challenges/), I haven't gotten around to creating a podcast. That has changed. I introduce to you, dear reader of Race Condition, the blog, Race Condition, [the podcast](https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/2077882.rss). Please enjoy the first episode. You can use that RSS URL in your podcast player _or_ search for "Race Condition" (no quotes) in the Apple Podcast Directory.

The subject of the podcast is _slightly_ narrower than that of this blog: just my work on side-project apps. Like the blog, the podcast has a pedagogic goal. Indeed, the first episode provides the listener with considerations for adopting WeatherKit. But the podcast has two other goals. First, I intend to use the podcast as motivation to work on my side projects. Because I plan to release episodes monthly, I'll need to work on something side-project-related at least once a month so that I have [something to talk about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ58TVYNFro). Second, I intend to make the listener laugh by, for example, recording satirical sponsor reads.

If you are interested in how I [made](https://professorbuzzkill.com/bismarck-laws-and-sausages/) the podcast and the first episode, read on.

## Hosting

I initially considered hosting the podcast on AWS. An episode, after all, is just a file, and my website, [hosted on AWS](https://racecondition.software/blog/meta/), already does RSS. [This article](https://podnews.net/article/podcast-hosted-on-amazon-aws) convinced me not to. Maintaining an RSS feed by hand would be error-prone, analytics would be non-existent, and costs would explode if the popularity of the podcast did.

I read a variety of podcast-host round-ups, and one host rose to the top: [BuzzSprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/). So I picked BuzzSprout and its $12-per-month plan. Although a low-traffic podcast would theoretically be cheaper to host on AWS, considering the value of my time, BuzzSprout is a bargain. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy creating a podcast using BuzzSprout was. So far, thumbs up.

## Scripting

I initially wasn't certain that I should or would fully script the first episode of Race Condition, not just make an outline and improvise my words based on that. Verily, two of my favorite podcasts, [Developing Perspective](https://developingperspective.com) and [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/), _are_ unscripted. But another of my favorite podcasts, [The History of English](https://historyofenglishpodcast.com), _is_ scripted. Both approaches work.

I _don't_ script conference talks because I observed, many years ago, that reading a script is completely incompatible with effective oratory. Some of my enjoyment of Hardcore History likely stems from Dan Carlin's [Coltrane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll3CMgiUPuU)-level verbal improvisation.

But I ended up deciding to script the episode for two reasons. First, one element of the episode, in particular the satirical advertisement, _required_ a script. Second, I am a perfectionist, and I appreciated the ability to maximize the eloquence of the episode, for example using [parallelism](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/writing-101-what-is-parallelism) in my descriptions of my side-project apps.

The script ended up consisting of 1,250 carefully chosen words.

## Recording

I used QuickTime Player and my RÃ¸de NT-USB Mini microphone to record my script chunk-by-chunk. Chunks ranged in length from one to three sentences. Longer chunks would have involved less work in terms of file handling and editing, but I found that I invariably gaffed while recording longer chunks, causing me to discard them.

Notwithstanding my lack of expertise in recording, I was aware of the need to avoid room echo and plosive pops. As far as my ears can tell, the recordings have neither. The man cave seems to be a decent recording studio, even without sound-absorption panels. I am pleased with my sound quality, but I welcome tips from listeners as to how I could improve it.

I ended up recording nineteen `m4a` chunks for my 1,250-word script.

## Editing

I also researched editing software for podcasts. I [read](https://www.thepodcasthost.com/editing-production/best-podcast-editing-software/) [about](https://riverside.fm/blog/podcast-editing-software) Adobe Audition, Audacity, Hindenburg Journalist, and Pro Tools. Some of these apps are quite expensive, and all have big learning curves. But then I realized that I am already familiar with an audio-editing app from my work on app previews: iMovie. This app doubtless lacks features of the others mentioned, but it had what I needed: the ability to import audio clips, chop them up, delete unwanted audio, change levels, and export MP3s. So I went with iMovie. Why change levels? The intro/outro music I got from [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com) was much louder than the audio I recorded, so I [equalized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2DfF2u1GqQ) them.

As I listened to my recordings on my headset, I noticed every inhalation and mouth click, and I chopped those out. Some listeners probably don't notice or don't care about inhalations or mouth clicks, but I find them, as a podcast listener, unpleasant and distracting.

## Error Message

Listeners might wonder what inspired me to record the WeatherKit error message as an angry Dalek. Here is the story behind that.

I learned Swift using a video course by Simon Allardice in 2015, and I've admired him since. In 2016, he wrote a [blog post](https://www.simonallardice.com/blog/2016/6/7/why-programming-manuals-arent-on-audiobook) explaining why programming manuals aren't on audiobook. Short answer: no matter how good the narrator, a spoken-word programming manual would sound ridiculous. What if, I wondered, I _narrated_ the inscrutable WeatherKit error message? I just had to.

The question remained of how to deliver the error message in a manner that kept the listener engaged. In Hardcore History, Dan Carlin reads book excerpts using an [angry delivery](https://youtu.be/oErYYBNCHh4?t=14982). The anger sometimes seems incongruous, but it somehow keeps _me_ engaged. "How angry can _this_ excerpt make Dan?", I wonder before the beginning of an excerpt reading. I decided to borrow Dan's angry delivery for my reading of the error message.

My [initial recording](https://raceconditionsoftware.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/angryError.m4a) of the error message was good and angry, but I decided I could make it sound even angrier. Nothing sounds angrier than a [Dalek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhEUBgu9j5Y) threatening extermination. Though my own accent is basically [General American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American_English), with some [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_English) and [New England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_English) influences, I _am_ able to reproduce the [Received Pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation) of Daleks. There is a website, [Voice Changer](https://voicechanger.io), that can modify a recording to make it sound more Dalek. So I recorded the error message using Received Pronunciation and went [full Dalek](https://raceconditionsoftware.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/soundbite.mp4) using Voice Changer.

## Satirical Advertisement

Many podcasts I love would not exist without advertisements. I am grateful for the support that sponsors provide. That said, having heard many thousands of advertisement readings over the years, I have observed certain patterns. Some readers are clearly not enthused to be reading their umpteenth Squarespace ad. Some readers perform their readings with fervor that _may_ not correspond to their actual enthusiasm for the product on offer. I decided to take the latter approach, [turned up to eleven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE). The world is not [crying out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKu7TYWNxqA) for dental floss as a service. Most people, I have observed, do not even _use_ dental floss. But notwithstanding of my own view of dental floss as a service, I applied maximum fervor to my reading.
