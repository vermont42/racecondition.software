I'm a software developer in San Francisco, California. Although my primary focus is Swift, I have also written code in Atari BASIC, GFA BASIC, HyperTalk, C++, C, SQL, PL/SQL, Java, Objective-C, BASH, and JavaScript.

Software is both my career and my hobby. As a hobbyist, I have released three iOS apps, [Immigration](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/immigration/id777319358), [RaceRunner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/racerunner-run-tracking-app/id1065017082), and [Conjugar](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conjugar/id1236500467), as well as a variety of [open-source](https://github.com/vermont42) libraries.

My interests outside software are wide-ranging and include linguistics, population genetics, geography, [podcasts](https://github.com/vermont42/Podcasts), and [jam bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHT7Kr_50Uo).

This website is largely a clone of Jesse Squires's [website](https://www.jessesquires.com), though it will likely diverge over time as I get the hang of web development in general and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in particular. I thank Mr. Squires for sharing the [implementation](https://github.com/jessesquires/jessesquires.com) of his website with the public.

You can [contact me here](/contact).
