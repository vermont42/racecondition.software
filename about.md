I'm a software developer based near San Francisco, California. As a proud New England native, I [pronounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_accent#Declining_features) "aunt" like it rhymes with "flaunt".

Although my primary language of late is Swift, I have also used Atari BASIC, GFA BASIC, HyperTalk, C++, C, SQL, Perl, PL/SQL, [Java](https://vimeo.com/250967769), Objective-C, BASH, Kotlin, JavaScript, and YAML.

I co-created the iPhone [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taxivq-virtualq-app-at-sfo/id1591307910) for San Francisco Airport taxi drivers. In my not-so-copious spare time, I have released four iOS apps: [Conjuguer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/conjuguer/id1588624373), [Conjugar](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conjugar/id1236500467), [RaceRunner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/racerunner-run-tracking-app/id1065017082), and [Immigration](https://youtu.be/WfLCwCJ95fM?si=zvr7GzqR_UdXhmqi), as well as a [variety](https://github.com/vermont42/Solver2) of open-source [projects](https://github.com/vermont42/Permitter) and even a [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/games/12580312998/) [game](https://vimeo.com/812106730). Using Claude Code, I'm developing the iOS app [Konjugieren](https://github.com/vermont42/Konjugieren).

I scripted, filmed, and edited [iOSExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/ios/product), a video course about getting a job as an iOS developer. Subjects of the course include concurrency, unit testing, take-home projects, and interviews. While creating the course, I learned about capturing high-quality [audio](https://youtu.be/xksmpCvSc94) and [video](https://youtu.be/tZ4Hn-3JURQ).

My interests outside software are wide-ranging and include [running](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/43825163/results), [linguistics](http://historyofenglishpodcast.com), [population genetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTY9K1Q_Sbg), [history](https://www.dancarlin.com), [geography](https://www.topozone.com/maine/lincoln-me/island/monhegan-island/), [podcasts](https://github.com/vermont42/Podcasts), [cats](https://vimeo.com/192207432), and [jam bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHT7Kr_50Uo).

This website started as a clone of Jesse Squires's [website](https://www.jessesquires.com). I thank Mr. Squires for sharing his [implementation](https://github.com/jessesquires/jessesquires.com).
