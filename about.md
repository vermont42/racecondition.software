I'm a software developer based near San Francisco, California. As a proud New England native, I [pronounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_accent#Declining_features) "aunt" like it rhymes with "flaunt".

Although my primary language of late is Swift, I have also used Atari BASIC, GFA BASIC, HyperTalk, C++, C, SQL, Perl, PL/SQL, [Java](https://vimeo.com/250967769), Objective-C, BASH, and JavaScript.

I co-created the iPhone app for San Francisco Airport taxi drivers and am now the architect of the Suki iOS [app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/suki/id1425102117). In my not-so-copious spare time, I have released four apps: [Conjuguer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/conjuguer/id1588624373), [Conjugar](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/conjugar/id1236500467), [RaceRunner](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/racerunner-run-tracking-app/id1065017082), and [Immigration](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/immigration/id777319358), as well as a [variety](https://github.com/vermont42/Solver2) of open-source [projects](https://github.com/vermont42/Permitter).

My interests outside software are wide-ranging and include [running](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/43825163/results), [linguistics](http://historyofenglishpodcast.com), [population genetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTY9K1Q_Sbg), [history](https://www.dancarlin.com), [geography](https://www.topozone.com/maine/lincoln-me/island/monhegan-island/), [podcasts](https://github.com/vermont42/Podcasts), [cats](https://vimeo.com/192207432), and [jam bands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHT7Kr_50Uo).

This website started as a clone of Jesse Squires's [website](https://www.jessesquires.com). I thank Mr. Squires for sharing his [implementation](https://github.com/jessesquires/jessesquires.com).
