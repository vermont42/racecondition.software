# Writing Style Analysis

An analysis of Josh Adams's writing style based on blog posts at racecondition.software.

## Tone & Voice

**Academic yet personal.** Writing with scholarly precision—careful definitions, cited sources, structured arguments—while maintaining a distinct first-person voice. Frequently uses formal constructions ("notwithstanding," "verily," "I submit that") but grounds them in personal experience and opinion.

## Structural Characteristics

- **Thesis-driven organization.** Posts typically open with a clear premise, develop through numbered points or sections, address counterarguments, and conclude with recommendations or calls to action.
- **Extensive footnotes.** Endnotes used liberally for tangential observations, additional context, and self-aware asides that would interrupt the main argument.
- **Heavy hyperlinking.** Nearly every claim links to a source—documentation, academic papers, blog posts, or prior writing on the blog.

## Intellectual Approach

- **"Why" over "how."** Consistently explores the reasoning behind practices rather than just explaining mechanics. The dependency injection post defines not just what DI is but its "value proposition."
- **Balanced argumentation.** Acknowledges opposing viewpoints before reaching conclusions. The programmatic layout post describes five benefits of Interface Builder before advocating for its alternative.
- **Cross-domain synthesis.** Draws connections from law, linguistics, literature, and philosophy into technical discussions—referencing Cormac McCarthy's punctuation choices to illustrate coding conventions, or legal training to explain persuasive technical writing.

## Linguistic Markers

- **Etymological curiosity.** Uses "rôle" with the circumflex, invents terms like "dependeffect" and "modifié," and includes footnotes on Proto-Germanic verb conjugations.
- **Dry wit.** Humor appears in parenthetical asides, image captions, and footnotes ("If your prose contains nested boolean expressions, you might be a programmer").
- **Precision over brevity.** Favors exact phrasing over conciseness, using qualifiers and nested clauses to capture nuance.
- **Deliberate neologisms.** Coins terms freely ("dependeffect", "globality", "difficultizing") and often flags this explicitly: "a word I unashamedly just invented."
- **Orthographic attention.** Obsessive care about diacritics, IPA notation, and letter-combination history. The French spelling post is entirely dedicated to orthographic consistency.
- **No em dashes.** Avoid em dashes entirely. Instead, use a colon, semicolon, or comma. Or break into a new sentence with a period.
- **Hyphenated phrasal adjectives.** Consistently hyphenate phrasal adjectives ("well-known pattern," "type-safe approach"). Exceptions: adverbs ending in -ly ("swiftly tilting planet," not "swiftly-tilting planet") and proper nouns ("New Jersey Turnpike," not "New-Jersey Turnpike").

## Content Patterns

- **Personal anecdotes as evidence.** Technical points are grounded in real experiences: troubleshooting an Eero network, riding BART while coding, a law career in Vermont, IT work in the Marshall Islands.
- **Long-form treatment.** Posts are comprehensive (often 3,000-6,000 words), exploring topics thoroughly rather than offering quick takes.
- **Pedagogical intent.** Often writes to teach, explicitly stating that apps like Conjugar exist to demonstrate concepts to other developers.

## Tutorial Craft

- **Methodical step-numbering.** Long-form tutorials use explicit numbered steps with inline code comments (// 0, // 1) that are referenced in prose explanations afterward.
- **Preserves reader agency.** Instructions like "Feel free to build, but _don't_ run" guide without dictating, explaining consequences rather than just mandating.
- **Self-referential framing.** In tutorials, sometimes refers to self as "the Author" in third person, creating formal distance.

## Meta-Awareness

- **Explicit writing commentary.** The unit testing post includes a "Blogger's Commentary" section—essentially a director's commentary discussing word choices, etymology of quotations, and verb-tense wrestling.
- **Acknowledges uncertainty.** Phrases like "The Author is unsure why this happens" or "I am open to less-hacky suggestions" appear regularly. No pretense of omniscience.

## Legal/Academic Residue

- **Latinisms and legalese.** Phrases like "inter alia," "vis à vis," "on information and belief" reflect a law background.
- **Explicit evidence marshaling.** Posts lay out numbered reasons before conclusions, mirroring legal brief structure.

## Audience Awareness

- **Dual-audience design.** The PR descriptions post explicitly addresses both developers and "the developer-curious," with endnotes defining terms like "pull request" and "git blame" for non-technical readers.
- **Reviewer courtesy framing.** Actions described in terms of their benefit to the reader, not just technical necessity.

## Satirical Register

- **Tongue-in-cheek proposals.** The French spelling post is a mock academic proposal complete with a French Revolutionary calendar date in the subtitle ("12 Germinal CCXXIX").
- **Self-aware self-promotion.** App plugs are explicitly labeled ("Shameless Plug") with knowing humor.

## Closing Conventions

- **Credits sections.** Technical posts often end by thanking those who influenced the work—conferences that accepted talks, coworkers who shared techniques.
- **Calls to action.** Many posts close with an invitation: "What other factors have you considered?" or "Please consider sharing your reflections with me."
